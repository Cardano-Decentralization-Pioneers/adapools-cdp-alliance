# Description

Decentralization is at the heart of the Cardano and IOHK missions and particularly in regions which don't have the benefit of western world institutions. Most countries in Africa, with the exception of South Africa, are not covered by giant datacenters like AWS, Gcloud, Contabo 

The cost of operating nodes in those countries is significantly higher than in Western Europe or the US. This portfolio is curated of pools that operate in remote locations, where the cost can be between 5 and 10x as compared to cheapest in Europe and by doing so they are supporting the local community and paying a very good rate by local standards.

The pools in this folio were the first ones to run nodes in remote locations. They support geographical distribution and diversification of hosting providers.

# Joining the Decentralization Pioneers Alliance

Pools that want to join after the 19th of August 2021 will need to request on the telegram channel (https://t.me/joinchat/lHeWL7PhNQkyZWQ0) and demonstrate how they quality (e.g. show their adapools page with relays).
The validation is handled manually through verifying the relays list on adapools.org. In case of conflicting requests the pool update list will be used to find out who was announcing a new relay earlier.

After proofing your qualification please go ahead with the below Registration Instructions.
When approved your pool will be listed in the Decentralization Pioneers Alliance on AdaPools on AdaFolio
